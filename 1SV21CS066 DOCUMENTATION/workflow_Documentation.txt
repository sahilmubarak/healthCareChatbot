Healthcare Chatbot

I downloaded the project files from the link provided

after unzipping the files i followed the "README" to run the model offline on my computer,

after installing all the needed components on to my computer using git bash. 

I tried to run the model but I didnt get any replies from the chatbot

I fixed some issues in the app.py file that didnt link to the right files but the issue prevailed.

I checked for firewall issues but that wasnt the problem

I am getting this error in the Rasabot now
" Could not load model due to The model version is trained using Rasa Open Source 3.1.0
 and is not compatible with your current installation which supports models build with Rasa Open Source 3.5.0 or higher.
 This means that you either need to retrain your model or revert back to the Rasa version that trained the model to ensure that the versions match up again.."

i have two possible sollution to this problem
1 is to downgrade to the required version
2 is to retrain the model

i am retrainig the model first

the chat bot is finally working after retraining it in the new version of rasa

i am now testing out the bot by having some conversations

the chatbot is working fine even after restarting the computer and servers

but it has limitations in the number of topics it can answer, for eg it gives the same answer
for all kinds of aches like headache and stomach ache, mostly because of the training data

I start analising all the files in the project to understand how it works

i found 3 files in the ..rasabot/data directory with extension .yml ,

I started searching about RASA , it is a tool for building conversational AI in other words chat bots,
turns out there are many ways of building chatbots and this project uses intents and actions

i did some modifications to the "nlu.yml" and "domain.yml" files and started training the rasabot on the new data.

i tried  testing to get the reply according to the modified data but didnt get any replies

i will have to retrain the model after modifying the stories.yml file

i added a new story path, named it story-time_path, the intent is fun_test and the action is start_playing
got an error "Encountered an exception while running action 'start_playing'.Bot will continue, 
but the actions events are lost. Please check the logs of your action server for more information."

looks like i need to change a few more files

I started modifying the existing index.html, index.css, index.js files to give the chatbot a more apealing front end

i started by changong the html file and adding the needed areas to it

then i modified the css file to suit the style for the healthcare website 

i then tested the working of the new webpage and fixed the new bugs that had arrised due to the modifications of the files

in the end the webpage was workin as i intended

i tested by changing the action name from start_playing to utter_start_playing and the new custom case works

i am finding ways to figure out ways to test the accuracy of a chatbot

after some research i found a command that can help with that for rasa

modified the data files(nlu,domain,stories) to now support multiple new responces and symptoms

i re-trained the model with the new data

after the training was done , i tested the accuracy of the model by running the rasa test command

after that was done i tested the working of the bot with the new responses and it worked perfectly
